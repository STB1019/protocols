## Markdown cheatsheet

This is intended as a quick reference and showcase. For more complete info, see [John Gruber's original spec](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and the [Github-flavored Markdown info page](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).

Note that there is also a [Cheatsheet specific to Markdown Here](./Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) if that's what you're looking for. You can also check out [more Markdown tools](./Other-Markdown-Tools).

## Headers

```
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

Alt-H1
======

Alt-H2
------
```

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

## Lists

(In this example, leading and trailing spaces are shown with with dots: ⋅)

```no-highlight
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. 
   Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces 
   (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
```

## Links

There are two ways to create links.

```no-highlight
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com
```

## Code and Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn't. 

```no-highlight
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
```

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code locks -- they're easier.
```
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

## Tables

include tex file with the table

## Horizontal Rule

```
Three or more...
---

Hyphens

***

Asterisks

___

Underscores
```

## Changes of executive

Comments work with a `\%` sign at the beginning and, in case we want to write the sign it needs to be escaped `\\\%`
%Change of executive
```
%Change of executive
